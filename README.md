===
This is an interactive interface for manipulating the dns record on dnspod.

## functions
One can use the interface to operate the dns record in dnspod easily.

## how to use
1. you should apply for an api token at first.
2. the api and token can either be provided by the file "apitoken.txt" (the api should in the format of "ID,TOKEN" on the first line) or in the command line argument (higher priority)
3. the command

```shell
$ python2 dnscmd.py 
```

brings you to the interactive terminal and now, use ```help``` to learn everything about the interactive interface.
